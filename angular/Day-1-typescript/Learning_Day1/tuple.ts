// tuples
let tuplesApply2 : [number,string] =[1,"Bind"];
console.log(tuplesApply2);
//  throws an error

// Type '[number, string, number]' is not assignable to type '[number, string]'.
//   Source has 3 element(s) but target allows only 2.
// let tuplesApply2: [number,string] =[1,"Bind",3];
//  you can acess any method of array which you are using in js
// it is always advisble to use tuple in key value pair more than 2 tuple will be confusing to us.
